		<p class=paragraph01> Pokemon short for the original name Pocket Monsters is one of the highest grossing games of all time coming second to the Mario franchise, both of which were owned by Nintendo. The Pokemon anime is one of the most widely watched children’s tv shows around the world. Pokemon is centered around creatures called “Pocket Monsters” or Pokemon for short, and Pokemon trainers. Pokemon trainers capture and battle their Pokemon for sport. The entire Pokemon world revolves around Pokemon. Each pokemon has a different type, which affects how they look and what they are good to battle against. <p>
		<p class=paragraph02> There are 18 different Pokemon types:<p>

		<p class=paragraph03> Each type is resistant to another type, supereffective to another type, or immune to another type. The most commonly known types are Fire, Water and Grass. Fire is supereffective on grass, grass is supereffective on water and water is supereffective on fire. Like this every type has their own resistances, advantages and immunities. Some pokemon can have more than one type, these are called dual type pokemon. Dual type Pokemon have a Primary type, and a Secondary type. This affects how other type moves affect the Pokemon. If one type is weak to a move, and another type resists the move the damage is neutral. If both types resist the move, the damage is ¼. If one type resists and one type is neutral the damage is ½. If one type is weak and the other type is neutral the damage is 2x. If both types are weak to the move the damage is 4x.</p>

		<p class=paragraph04> Pokemon are trained in a level based system going from 1-100. In the anime and trading cards the level based system is rarely mentioned, but in the games it is a very key component of the games. Each pokemon has different stats(statistics). There are six stats that every pokemon has. The HP (Hit Points) stat, the Attack stat, The Special Attack stat, the Defense stat, the Special Defense stat and the speed stat. Each of these stats affects how the pokemon performs in battle. The special attack and special defense stats determine the damage in HP from special attacking moves, The attack and defense stats determine the damage in HP from attacking moves. Each pokemon has unique base stats that can be maximized through training. If a pokemon with a low base speed stat is trained in speed, it will never be faster than a pokemon with a high base speed stat that is trained in speed. Each pokemon has their own strengths and weakness and to perform at their best, should be trained accordingly. As pokemon level up their stats are increased and they learn different moves. The moves that they learn can be learned naturally, by breeding, with move tutors, or with Technical or Hidden machines. There are three stages in a pokemon’s growth. The basic stage, stage 1 and stage 2. Some pokemon can evolve two times where as some don’t evolve at all. Generally the major factor in evolving a pokemon is level, but for some pokemon they require trading, happiness, certain held items and evolutionary stones. Some pokemon can evolve into different stage 1 or 2 pokemon’s based on many factors. One example is a popular pokemon called Eevee. Eevee is a basic stage normal type pokemon. It can evolve into 8 different pokemon based on different factors. If a water, fire, leaf, or thunder stone is used, it will evolve into the respective evolutions. If it is evolved with maximum happiness during either day, or night it will evolve into the respective evolutions. If it is leveled up near a icy stone it will evolve into the respective evolution. If it is leveled up with 2 levels in affection and a fairy type move it will evolve into a different evolution. As pokemon they gain stats, can gain or lose types and generally become better. All of the above factors are used in the most important part of pokemon, pokemon battling.</p>
